## How I Take Notes

Initially, I take notes by hand (either with pen and paper or Apple pencil and iPad). I then transcribe my handwritten notes to text via a Reading Log Tracker I created on Notion. During the transcription process, I further summarize and organize my key takeaways from the text.
