## Note Taking Process 📓

Initially, I take notes by hand (either with pen and paper or an Apple pencil and iPad). I then transcribe my handwritten notes to text via a Reading Log Tracker created in Notion. During the transcription process, I further summarize and organize my key takeaways from the text to create a brief overview of the text.
