# How to Solve It: A New Aspect of Mathematical Method
## Overview

### First - Understanding the Problem

* What is the unknown? What are the data? What is the condition?
* If there is a figure related to the problem, draw the figure.
* Use suitable notation.

#### Stage One: Getting Acquainted

* Begin at the problem statement.
* Visualize the problem as a whole without thinking too much about the details yet.
* Taking time to familiarize yourself with the problem may allow you to recollect relevant points further into the problem solving process.

#### Stage Two: Working for Better Understanding

* Begin once again at the statement of the problem and until the statement is thoroughly embedded in your memory that you can recollect it, even if for a moment you might lose sight of it. 
* Pinpoint the principal parts of the problem, then consider them one by one and in combinations.

### Second - Devising a Plan

The skill of devising the best problem solving strategy is honed by continuous practice. Some strategies mentioned are:
* Process of elimination
* Considering edge cases
* Working backwards
* Solving a related problem
* Using direct reasoning 

### Third - Carrying Out the Plan 

Follow the plan. If it continues not to work, move on to the next plan. 

### Fourth - Looking Back

Take time to look back and consider what worked and what didn't. Retrospection allows you to be able to gain skill in the being able to predict future strategies for future problems.
