# What Every Programmer Should Know About Memory - Notes
### Intro

* Overtime the performance of mass storage and memory subsystems fell behind
* Software techniques have been used in an effort to combat slow mass storage (i.e. caching)
* Most solutions to adressing main memory as a bottleneck have been focused on hardware changes

### Commodity Hardware
* More cost effective to horizontally scale
* Standardized on a chipset with a **Northbridge** and **Southbridge**
* All CPUs connected via the **Front Side Bus (FSB)** to Northbridge
* Northbridge contains memory controller which determines the type of RAM chips used
